#bio_scripting_homework_5

Part 1 involves fixing a broken shell script. Since the shell does not do well with floats, basic calculator (bc) was used for many of the commands contained in the script.

Part 2 involves appending information about the ASC to a file. The two script runs were supposed to be ~60 minutes apart, but was run for a second time a few hours later. Results still showed that the script appeared to be running correctly.

Part 3 involves fixing a broken python script. It is very similar to Part 1 in the contents of the script, but runs in a slightly different way. Strings were converted into integers, and the script ran fairly smoothly after that.

Overall, the scripts for Part 1 and Part 3 perform far better than they did originally, although more improvements can definitely be made to them for better overall execution.
